## Features

- **Automated Proxy Scraping**: We harvest over 10,000 proxies daily from more than 50 global sources, ensuring a diverse pool of reliable proxies.
- **Proxy Validation**: Each proxy undergoes rigorous testing for speed, uptime, and anonymity to ensure you only get the best quality proxies.
- **Regular Updates**: The proxy list is refreshed every 24 hours to ensure you have access to the latest proxies available.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Proxies are scraped from multiple trusted sources, ensuring both diversity and high reliability.
2. **Testing & Validation**: Each proxy undergoes several tests, including:
   - **Speed tests**: Measures the proxy's response time.
   - **Uptime checks**: Verifies the proxy's availability.
   - **Anonymity levels**: Tests how well the proxy masks user data.
3. **Publishing**: Once validated, the proxies are compiled and published in our [Latest Proxies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/complexorganizations/proxy-registry/main/assets/hosts) list.
