# Proxy-Registry

## Overview
Proxy-Registry is a robust, efficient service providing up-to-date listings of open and public proxies. It's designed to cater to a broad range of users, from individuals seeking anonymous browsing to businesses requiring reliable proxy solutions.

- **Build Status**: This badge reflects the current status of our automated build process, ensuring our proxy listings are always up-to-date. [![Updating the resources](https://github.com/complexorganizations/proxy-registry/actions/workflows/auto-update-repo.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/complexorganizations/proxy-registry/actions/workflows/auto-update-repo.yml)

## Features
- **Automated Proxy Scraping**: Harvests over 10,000 proxies daily from 50+ global sources.
- **Proxy Validation**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to test and validate each proxy for speed, uptime, and anonymity.
- **Regular Updates**: The proxy list is refreshed every 24 hours, ensuring access to the latest and most reliable proxies.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Proxies are scraped from multiple sources, ensuring diversity and reliability.
2. **Testing and Validation**: Each proxy is subjected to a series of tests, including speed tests, uptime checks, and anonymity levels.
3. **Publishing**: Valid proxies are compiled and published at [Latest Proxies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/complexorganizations/proxy-registry/main/assets/hosts).
